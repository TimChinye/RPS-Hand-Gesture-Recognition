The model has learned some distinct features (like the closed fist for `rock`, giving it high precision), but it lacks the sophistication to differentiate between the more nuanced open-fingered gestures. This demonstrates the inherent difficulty of training a deep network from scratch on a limited dataset, even a clean one."

By removing the background \"cheat\" from the V1 data, the model was forced to solve the harder, correct problem. This 74% score reflects a **genuine understanding** of the hand gestures, proven by its more equitable performance across all classes. This demonstrates the critical principle that a lower accuracy on the correct problem is more valuable than a high accuracy on the wrong one."
