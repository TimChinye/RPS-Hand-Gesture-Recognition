    "\n",
    "With a clean dataset prepared in the previous step, we can now focus on the models. The assessment brief requires us to experiment with two approaches:\n",
    "1.  **A CNN built from scratch:** This establishes a baseline and demonstrates foundational knowledge of neural network architecture.\n",
    "2.  **A model using Transfer Learning:** This leverages a powerful, pre-trained network (MobileNetV2) to achieve higher performance with less data and training time.\n",

    "- Setting up data generators with augmentation.\n",
    "- Defining the architecture for both models.\n",
    "- Compiling the models with an optimizer and loss function.\n",
    "- Running the training loop (`.fit()` method).\n",
